# vinyl-collection-with-discogs
Placeholder for a basic app that I'll create to keep track of my collection of vinyl records. It will use mySQL as the database, Python Flask as the web framework and SQLAlchemy as a middle layer between the two. Future work may include Dockerizing this app once the basic functionality is developed.
